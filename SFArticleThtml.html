<h2>What sales force is:</h2>
<p>Sales force is a cloud computing company thats main product is a customer relationship management tool. Sales force started 16 years ago back in 1999, now their service is responsible for over a billion transaction every day. At times of peak demand, sales force handles upwards of 24,000 database transactions each second.</p>
<h2>What is a customer relationship management product:</h2>
                <p>A customer relationship management product is a tool used by companies to interact with current customers and future customers to come. These interactions could be the automation of billing between a client and a company, the organization of a marketing strategy, and much more. </p>
<h2>What cloud computing is:</h2>
<p>The idea of cloud computing refers to the deployment of groups of servers along with software packages to build an environment of computing resources that can be leveraged for various business needs.</p>
<h2> Benefits of cloud computing:</h2>
<p>A major appeal to cloud computing is it means that companies don’t actually have to own the computing resource themselves.  The companies no longer need to physically have the server(s) on their premises, as they can just use the cloud.  Not having to physically house and manage the servers saves companies a lot of upfront cost as well as recurring expenses due to maintenance. Another major benefit of cloud computing compared to the traditional model of housing the computing resources on site is that if there is a time of greater than expected load on the system,  the companies whole system could potentialy breaks down.  In the cloud computing model that is not an issue, as if a time occurs where there is a larger than expected load on the system, more computing resources are allocated on demand to account for this.</p>
<h2> Technology driving sales force:</h2>
<p>By no means is there one piece of technology that drives this monolithic system, back in 2013 there were about a dozen different software packages being utilized to run their cloud, with over 15,000 hardware system.
To name a few of the software packages sales force leverages: Linux, Solaris 10 with ZFS, Jettty, Solr, Memcache, Apache QPID, and QFS.
The main driver behind sales force is an incredibly powerful data base system, which on average handles a request in 300 miliseconds. Salesforce whole system is run on about 1000 servers in all, there are only about 10 data bases in all that all of sales force relies on, these databases run on about 50 servers.  Salesforce does not rely on open source practices for managing their data base, such as index, instead they have developed their own more efficient methods, that they own patents on.  The real secret is their ‘optimizer’ “which queries the databases and makes sense of all the data” (Schonfeld).</p>
